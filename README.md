# Library Volunteer System

The /Library Volunteer System/ is a program that stores volunteer profiles and produces a corresponding volunteer shift schedule based on user-defined preferences. This program was designed in order to optimize my high school libraryâ€™s volunteer management system.

## Roadmap

The following list details ideas for possible development in the future.

* Support for exporting volunteer profiles and schedule to be used elsewhere (e.g. to Google Calendar, Contacts) or even the creation of an online database so that the program may be used by multiple users.
* Fleshed-out help/instruction menu items for each GUI frame to make it easier for users to understand and use the program.
* An improved optimization algorithm for shift allocation of volunteers; currently program uses brute force, which becomes inefficient when tasked with many volunteers.
* More preference options for user when organizing profiles and schedule. 
* Encryption of log-in usernames, passwords, and all volunteer information in the text file databases. This would a big priority as all data is currently being stored as plaintext, which is somewhat pathetically unsafe.
