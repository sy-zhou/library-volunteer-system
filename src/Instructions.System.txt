Welcome to the VP Library Volunteer System. These are the Volunteer and Timetable panels. 

In the Volunteers panel, you can view the volunteers in your library system. You can 
left-click on one of the volunteers to view their profile. From their profile, you can 
edit the volunteer or delete them. From the Volunteers panel, you can also add a 
volunteer and adjust the display of volunteers. Please note the following instructions 
for searching through the list of volunteers:

Search Criteria:
- when searching NAMES, the search term can be a part of a name
- when searching STUDENT NUMBER, the search term must be the entire student number

In the Timetable panel, you can add volunteers to certain shifts in the timetable. You
can also save your work in the system and exit the program from both panels.
